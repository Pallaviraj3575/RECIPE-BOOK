        <ol>
            <li> Prepare saffron-kewra water and chop veggies<br>
                To make a delightful chicken biryani dish, firstly
                soak saffron in water to prepare saffron water (one tsp saffron can be soaked in 1/4 cup water). 
                Next, mix kewra drops in water and mix well to make kewra water. Set them aside for later usage.
                Now, chop the onion and coriander leaves and keep them aside.</li>
            <li> Saute the onions<br>
                Meanwhile, heat olive oil in a deep bottomed pan. Once the oil is hot enough, add cumin seeds,
                bay leaf, green cardamom, black cardamom, cloves in it, and saute for about a minute.
                Then, add chopped onion to it and saute until pink. Now, add chicken into it with slit green
                chillies, turmeric, salt to taste, ginger-garlic paste, red chilli powder and green chilli paste.
                Mix well all the spices and cook for 2-3 minutes. Then, add hung curd into it and give a mix.
                (Make sure the chicken is washed properly and patted dry before adding it to the dish)</li>
            <li> Cook biryani on low heat for 5-6 minutes<br>
                Turn the flame to medium again and add garam masala in it along with ginger julienned,
                coriander and mint leaves. Add kewra water, rose water and 1 tsp saffron water in it. 
                Cook till the chicken is tender. Then add 1 cup cooked rice and spread evenly. 
                Then add the remaining saffron water and pour ghee over it. You can now cook the dish
                without the lid or cover it with a lid to give a dum-effect due to the steam formation.</li>
            <li>Serve hot chicken biryani with your favourite chutney or raita<br>
                Cook for 15-20 minutes with a closed lid and garnish with 1 tbsp
                 fried onions and coriander leaves. Serve hot chicken biryani with

        <li> Chop the vegetables and wash chicken<br>
            Chicken Momos is a dish that needs no introduction. 
            However, it is pretty easy to prepare it at home without putting in much effort. 
            Here’s how you go about preparing it at home: To begin with, rinse the veggies and chicken 
            with lukewarm water to thoroughly clean them. Then take a clean chopping board, chop the 
            vegetables separately and keep them aside.</li>
        <li> Boil the chicken and then shred well<br>
            Then take a pan or a pressure cooker and boil the chicken, with a pinch of salt and pepper. 
            If you want to make it aromatic, you can add a small teaspoon of ginger and chilli garlic paste. 
            If you like the flavour of garlic, you can add some more garlic paste. Once done, 
            carefully mince the boiled chicken. Keep it aside.</li>
        <li> Prepare the dough and filling for Chicken <br>
            Now, take a deep mixing bowl and add refined oil in it followed by all-purpose flour and salt. 
            Mix well with enough water and knead the mixture into a smooth dough. Knead well and ensure that no 
            lumps are formed. Take another mixing bowl and add chicken followed by chopped vegetables, mix well 
            and combine everything together. Then, add soy sauce to the chicken mix and stir well. Now take the 
            prepared dough and roll out small balls out of it.</li>
        <li>Flatten the dough balls and fill it with chicken stuffing, and steam for 20 minutes<br>
            Using a rolling pin, flatten the balls in a square shape and add the chicken and veggies 
            stuffing at the centre. Bring the edges close and secure them to make a momo. 
            Repeat this step with the remaining balls. Transfer the prepared momos to a steamer and 
            steam for 20 minutes or until they turn soft and tender. Serve fresh and hot with your choice of 
            chutney or dip.</li>
